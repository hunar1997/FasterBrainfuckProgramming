# This is in the planning stage :)

I have this project called [FasterBrainfuckProgramming](https://github.com/hunar1997/FasterBrainfuckProgramming) which is a mini language that compiles to the [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) programming language, I made it very efficient, it produces much more compact and faster code than [c2bf](https://github.com/arthaud/c2bf) or [elvm](https://github.com/shinh/elvm)

The problem is I don't have time to work on it :( the syntax is very weird in c++ so in the future i'm porting it to pil :)
